# Reversing_Notes

Hi everyone, this repository has been created to support my [personal](https://viuleeenz.github.io/) blog. The main goal is to store all files related to each blogpost in order to be easily retrieved by anyone interested to dig deeper in a specific topic. `I’ll try to keep everything properly organized and easy to browse`. If some sections are self-explanatory (e.g., Configuration extractors), others could be a little bit disorienting without a proper context and for them I’ll try to keep a dedicated READ.ME file to make it a little bit easier to explore.

Hope you enjoy.
